# advent-of-code-2024
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about).
is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
This repository holds my solutions to most exercises.
Cool stuff, enjoy!
